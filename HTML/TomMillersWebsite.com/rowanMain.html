<td><i>Airport Simulation (Menu-Driven)</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In Data Structures & Algorithms, our final project was to design an menu based airport simulator. The user could open, and close runways and also add planes to the airport. Planes could take off, or be denied takeoff, and then put on a different runway. The main focus was to get greater experience with stacks, queues, and lists.</td>

<td><i>SAT Solver</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In Design & Analysis of Algorithms, we were put into a group of 3 and took on the task of creating our own SAT Solver. We learned a lot about code efficiency and runtimes, while also learning about famous computing problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><i>SAT Solver with Backtracking</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In DAA, soon after we finished our SAT Solver, we were instructed to make another one that implemented backtracking. This taught us how programs could be made better with different approaches, and gave lots of experience with backtracking and recursion.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><i>Sudoku with SAT Solver</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>For our final DAA project, we had to create a program that would solve any sudoku puzzle. We had to take in an input from a file, convert it into a format that a SAT Solver could use, run it through the SAT, and then decode the output to show either a solver puzzle, or a message saying that the puzzle could not be solved. Ours was very efficient and could solve a 49x49 board in about 9 minutes!</td>

<td><i>Election Predictor</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In Programming Languages, we were given the same prompt throughout the semester, but told to create the program with a new language each time. The languages used were Java, Scheme, Ada, & Prolog. The prompt was to create a program that would allow a user to enter candidates, candidate's home state, candidate's region, number of commercials, and number of speeches given. After the input was done, the program would run through the data and calculate points depending on the input. Then it would output the points for each candidate, and select which candidate had the best chance of winning.</td>

<td><i>Software Engineering Project</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We are learning about scrum methodology, and how it is used. My group was given a project to complete by the end of the semester, but we had to do this by following the rules of scrum. We had a real client, and had to discuss the project with them at the end of every sprint. We learned about waterfall too, but mostly focused on scrum. For the project, we learned about cryptology, databases, and data scanning.</td>
