<td><i>Cross Country Simulation</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This was done in the beginner java class. We were instructed to make a program that generates a random number of teams, which each had a random number of runners on them. Each runner would have a randomly generated time that it took them to finish the race, and in the end, it would calculate the times and se which team won. I added a little extra and added randomly generated names to the runners, and also added Cumberland County College's actual team to the list.</td>

<td><i>Airport Simulator (with GUI)</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This was done in the intermediate java class. The whole class was split into groups of 3 and given a specific part of the project to create. Once a group finished their part, they would get added to another part of the project. The project was an airport simulator that would keep track of planes coming in, and leaving an airport. We had to also keep track of the runways, and which were clear. After all of that was made, we had to create a GUI to show it all. I started on the Plane class, and moved around between other classes such as Runway, and City.</td>

<td><i>Client & Server Hangman</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In my C++ class, me and 3 other students were too advanced for the material, since it was an intro class. We were placed in the back of the class and finished up the advanced C++ chapters. After that, we were allowed to choose out next project. We got to learn some prolog, and created a client and server hangman project. Multiple people could get on if they had it installed, and they would be joined together in a round of hangman. They could choose there own word, and the other person would have to guess it one letter at a time.</td>

<tr>
<td><i>Movie Theatre Database</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In my database management class, our final project was to create a database for what a real company might want. Me and my partner chose Regal Cinemas, and we created it to store info like stock, employees, theatres, etc. We learned a lot about MySQL, and how to properly design a database.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><i>Various Websites</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In my web design class, I had already known a decent amount of html, so the professor offered to let me see him earlier in the day for a little while and teach me so I wouldn't have to show up to the later class. I declined that because I was helping out quite a few students in the class. There was no big project in this class, but we did make several websites. We also learned how to use wordpress, but I still prefer to just do it by hand.</td>
